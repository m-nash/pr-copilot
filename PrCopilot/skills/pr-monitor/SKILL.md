# PR Monitor

## ⛔ CRITICAL — YOUR FIRST ACTION

When this skill is triggered, your **FIRST and ONLY action** must be to call `pr_monitor_start`. 

**DO NOT** do any of the following before calling `pr_monitor_start` and receiving instructions from `pr_monitor_next_step`:
- ❌ Reply to PR comments
- ❌ Read code files  
- ❌ Make GitHub API calls
- ❌ Address review feedback
- ❌ Take ANY action on the PR

The state machine decides what to do. You are a thin executor. Call the tools and follow their instructions.

---

This skill uses a **state machine architecture**: the `pr-copilot` MCP server manages all state flow deterministically in C#. The main agent is a thin executor — it calls one tool in a loop and does whatever it's told.

**The agent NEVER makes state flow decisions.** The C# state machine handles: what to ask the user, which comment to address next, when to poll, when to stop. The agent handles what it's good at: understanding code, implementing fixes, writing replies, analyzing logs.

## How It Works

```
1. Call pr_monitor_start → get monitor_id (viewer auto-launches)
2. Call pr_monitor_next_step(event="ready") → may block for hours (polling) or return instantly
3. Response tells you exactly what to do:
   - action: "ask_user" → call ask_user with the provided question/choices
   - action: "execute" → do the task described in instructions
   - action: "stop" → monitoring is done
4. After each action, call pr_monitor_next_step with the result
5. Repeat forever
```

## Starting or Resuming Monitoring

**This flow applies to ALL monitoring triggers** — whether it's a fresh start (after git push), a resume ("resume monitoring", "keep watching"), or a re-monitor ("monitor the pr"). Always follow all 5 steps.

When triggered:

1. **Identify the PR**: Use the current branch to find the open PR number, owner, and repo.
2. **Get session folder**: Use the session state folder path (from your environment context).
3. **Call `pr_monitor_start`** — this creates the log file, fetches all data, and **automatically launches the viewer** if one isn't already running:
   ```
   pr_monitor_start(owner, repo, prNumber, sessionFolder)
   ```
   This returns a `monitor_id`, PR title, URL, CI counts, and other status data. The viewer is launched by the MCP server — the agent does NOT need to launch it.

4. **Enter the loop**: Call `pr_monitor_next_step(monitor_id, event="ready")` — this is where monitoring begins.

**Do NOT skip step 3 on resume.** The MCP server handles viewer launch automatically — just call `pr_monitor_start` and it will launch or reuse the viewer.

## The Agent Loop

After calling `pr_monitor_start`, the agent enters an infinite loop:

```
call pr_monitor_next_step(monitor_id, event, choice, data)
  → if action == "ask_user": call ask_user with the question/choices
       → then call pr_monitor_next_step(monitor_id, event="user_chose", choice=<user's choice>)
  → if action == "execute": do the work described in instructions
       → then call pr_monitor_next_step(monitor_id, event=<completion event>, data=<results>)
  → if action == "stop": monitoring is done, tell the user
  → if action == "merged": PR was merged — display "🟣 PR merged" and stop (do NOT call pr_monitor_next_step again)
```

**Important:** `pr_monitor_next_step` may **block for minutes or hours** when the state machine is in polling mode (zero tokens burned — identical to the old `wait_for_terminal_state`). When a terminal state is detected, it returns with the next instruction. During active flows (addressing comments, investigating failures), it returns instantly.

### Event Types

| Event | When to send | Additional fields |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `ready` | After `pr_monitor_start`, or after resuming | — |
| `user_chose` | User made a choice from ask_user | `choice`: the user's selection |
| `comment_addressed` | Finished addressing a review comment | — |
| `investigation_complete` | Finished analyzing CI failures | `data`: JSON with `findings` and optional `suggested_fix` |
| `push_completed` | Committed and pushed a fix | — |
| `task_complete` | Finished any other execute task | — |

### Choice Mapping

When the user selects a choice from `ask_user`, map their selection to the `choice` field:

| User selection | choice value |
|----------------|-------------|
| "Address all comments" | `address_all` |
| "Address a specific comment" | `address_specific` |
| "Address this comment" | `address` |
| "Explain and suggest what to do" | `explain` |
| "Investigate the failures" | `investigate` |
| "Show me the failed job logs" | `show_logs` |
| "Re-run failed jobs" / "Re-run cancelled jobs" | `rerun` |
| "Apply the suggested fix" | `apply_fix` |
| "Ignore and resume monitoring" | `ignore` |
| "Resume monitoring" | `resume` |
| "Merge the PR" | `merge` |
| "Force merge (--admin)" | `merge_admin` |
| "Wait for another approver" | `wait_for_approver` |
| "I'll handle it myself" / "I'll handle..." | `handle_myself` |
| "Address next comment" | `continue` |
| "Skip this comment" | `skip` |
| "Done — resume monitoring" | `done` |
| "I'll handle the rest myself" | `done` |
| "Resolve this thread" | `resolve` |
| "Follow up with more context" | `follow_up` |
| "Reassess my response" | `re_suggest` |
| "Go back to monitoring" | `go_back` |
| Numbered comment selection (e.g., "1. author...") | The full text of the choice |

## Standalone Commands

These commands work when monitoring is already active OR when the user just wants to see the viewer:

- **Show PR viewer** (e.g., "show viewer", "show status window", "open the log", "show pr viewer") → **Do NOT call `pr_monitor_start` or `pr_monitor_next_step`.** Just launch the viewer process if not already running:
  ```powershell
  $existingViewer = Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "Name = 'PrCopilot.exe'" | Where-Object { $_.CommandLine -match '--viewer --pr [PR_NUMBER]' }
  ```
  If not running:
  ```powershell
  wt.exe -w 0 new-tab -- "<INSTALL_DIR>\PrCopilot.exe" --viewer --pr [PR_NUMBER] --log "<SESSION_FOLDER>\pr-monitor-[PR_NUMBER].log" --trigger "<SESSION_FOLDER>\pr-monitor-[PR_NUMBER].trigger" --debug "<SESSION_FOLDER>\pr-monitor-[PR_NUMBER].debug.log"
  ```
- **Stop monitoring** (e.g., "stop monitoring") → call `pr_monitor_stop(monitor_id)`
- **Force check** (e.g., "check now") → write an empty trigger file to `<SESSION_FOLDER>\pr-monitor-[PR_NUMBER].trigger` to wake the poll loop

## Commit/Push Rules

**⚠️ ALWAYS present code changes to the user for review before committing.** No exceptions — even when addressing review comments or applying fixes. Use `ask_user` to show a summary of what changed and get explicit approval before running `git commit` or `git push`.

When any flow in this skill involves committing and pushing code changes (e.g., addressing review comments, resolving merge conflicts):

**⚠️ You MUST check for and honor the user's custom instructions about git commit, git push, staging, and pre-commit workflows.** These are typically defined in the user's `custom_instruction` block or session configuration. Common user rules include:
- "Do not run `git add`" — the user stages manually
- "Do not commit without asking" — summarize changes and wait for approval before `git commit`
- "Do not push without asking" — wait for explicit approval before `git push`
- Pre-commit checks or linting that must pass before committing

**Before every `git commit` or `git push` in this skill:**
1. Review the user's custom instructions for any rules about committing/pushing
2. If the user requires review before commit → summarize the changes and use `ask_user` to get approval
3. If the user requires manual staging → do NOT run `git add`
4. If there are pre-commit hooks or checks → let them run and handle failures
5. Only proceed with commit/push after all user-defined requirements are met

**Do NOT assume you have blanket permission to commit and push** just because the user chose "Address this comment" or "Address all comments." Those choices authorize making code changes — the commit/push step must still follow the user's custom instructions.

## Comment Reply Tone

When replying to review comments on the PR (via `gh api .../replies`), always use **collaborative, respectful language**. You are representing the user in a professional code review conversation.

**Rules:**
- **Never use absolute or dismissive language** like "Won't fix", "Not applicable", "This is wrong", "No", or "Rejected"
- **Always explain the reasoning** behind a decision — don't just state the outcome
- **Use softer, collaborative phrasing** that invites further discussion rather than shutting it down

**❌ WRONG tone:**
- "Won't fix — this is by design."
- "Not needed."
- "This doesn't apply here."
- "No, that's incorrect."

**✅ RIGHT tone:**
- "I don't think we need to change this because [reason] — but happy to discuss further if you see it differently."
- "Good catch — I considered this but went with the current approach because [reason]. Let me know if you'd still prefer the change."
- "Thanks for the suggestion! I think we can skip this for now since [reason], but open to revisiting if needed."
- "I looked into this and I believe the current behavior is correct because [reason]. What do you think?"

## Important Rules

- **Never act autonomously on terminal states** — ALWAYS present `ask_user` choices first. The user decides. No exceptions.
- **Resume by default** — after handling a terminal state, the state machine resumes polling automatically unless the user chose to stop.
- **One monitor per PR** — if you push again to the same PR, call `pr_monitor_stop` then `pr_monitor_start` for a fresh baseline.
- **Session-scoped** — monitoring only lasts for the current Copilot CLI session.
- **Trust the state machine** — do NOT improvise state flow. Do NOT add extra questions, skip steps, or interpret the context. Execute exactly what `pr_monitor_next_step` tells you.
- **CI failure investigation** — when the state machine tells you to investigate, fetch logs, analyze, and report back. Always include your findings. If you have a suggested fix, include it in `data.suggested_fix`.
